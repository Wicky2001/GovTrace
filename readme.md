## Overview

GovTrace is a blockchain-powered platform developed to combat corruption in Sri Lanka's government financial system. By leveraging the Cardano blockchain, the system records and traces all government financial transactions, ensuring transparency and accountability. An integrated AI agent facilitates public access to transaction data while safeguarding sensitive information.

## Problem

Sri Lanka faces extensive corruption, particularly in government financial transactions. A significant issue is the difficulty in tracking and identifying the individuals responsible for these transactions—who made them, when, and why. Without the ability to trace these transactions, it becomes nearly impossible to take legal action against those involved in corrupt practices. As a result, corrupt practices thrive unchecked, leading to an estimated Rs. 300 billion lost annually in government tender procurements alone.

## Solution

GovTrace utilizes blockchain technology to securely store and trace all government financial transactions. Smart contracts automate procurement processes, and an AI agent assists the public in querying transaction data. The platform ensures that sensitive information is encrypted, while public transaction data is easily accessible for audits and investigations, making it easier to identify wrongdoers and take legal action.

## Features

- **Blockchain Transparency**: All government financial transactions are recorded on the Cardano blockchain, ensuring data integrity and transparency.
- **AI Agent**: A user-friendly AI agent that allows the public to ask questions and access transaction data, with protection of sensitive information.
